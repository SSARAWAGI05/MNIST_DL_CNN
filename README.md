## About The Project
This project is a deep learning-based real-time digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It integrates live video capture to recognize and classify handwritten digits displayed to the camera. The model is trained to detect digits (0-9) and provides predictions based on the frames captured in real-time, making it a practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

---

## Built With
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Keras**: For the high-level neural network API used to create the CNN.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and real-time processing.
- **NumPy**: For efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs (if required for future work).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies, train the model, and run the real-time digit recognition script. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to set up and deploy the project.

---

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SSARAWAGI05/RealTimeOCROfDigits.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd REALTIMEOCROFDIGITS
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (listed below).

---

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
   
You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a system capable of recognizing handwritten digits in real-time using a live camera feed. Traditional digit recognition models are trained on static images, but this project extends the concept by applying it to dynamic, real-world data, allowing users to interactively test the model by drawing digits in front of a camera.

## Key Features
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: The project implements a CNN for feature extraction and classification of the MNIST dataset digits.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Includes random transformations like rotation, zoom, and translation to improve model generalization.
3. **Real-time Digit Classification**: Uses OpenCV to capture video frames, preprocess them, and classify digits in real-time.
4. **Confidence Threshold**: Displays prediction results only if the model is confident (above 70% certainty) to improve prediction reliability.
5. **User-Friendly Display**: The camera feed shows the recognized digit and the modelâ€™s confidence on the screen for easy interpretation.
